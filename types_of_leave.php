Leave for religious holidays 

Labour Law does not to regulate leave for religious holidays.  At present the situation is that should an employee wish to take leave for the purpose of religious holidays other than an official public holiday, then the employee must take paid annual leave or unpaid leave.  Any paid annual leave taken will be deductible from the employees annual leave entitlement.

 Unpaid leave

Unpaid leave is referred to in the Act only in terms of what the employer is entitled to do when an employee’s sick leave or annual leave has been exhausted - the employer may then allow (or require) the employee to take unpaid leave. However, there is no provision in the Act that allows an employee to demand that he/she be permitted to take unpaid leave.
